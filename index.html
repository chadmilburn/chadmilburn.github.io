    Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. <br>
    Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, <br>
    when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. <br>
    It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. <br>
    It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, <br> 
    and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. <br>
    The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, <br>
    content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum <br>
     as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. <br>
     Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like). <br>
